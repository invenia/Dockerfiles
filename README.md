Dockerfiles
===========

Dockerfiles is a catch-all repository which holds the instructions, or Dockerfiles, which
are used in building Docker images. Typically each service has its own repo which contains
various Dockerfile revisions of the service but at the moment we're starting by having all
of our Dockerfiles in a single place.
