#!/bin/bash

# Provides support to `#!` (shebang) lines which include arguments. Emulates the behaviour of
# `/usr/bin/env -S` from coreutils 8.30 (https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?env).
#
# If a script named "hello.jl" had the shebang line:
#
#     #!/root/env-split julia -e 'include(popfirst!(ARGS))'
#
# and the script was run via `./hello.jl world` then the arguments given to `env-split` would be:
#
#     arg[0] = "julia -e 'include(popfirst!(ARGS))'"
#     arg[1] = "./hello.jl"
#     arg[2] = "world"
#

IFS=$'\n' shebang=( $(xargs printf '%s\n' <<<$1) )
